Welcome to Flexx's documentation!
=================================

.. automodule:: flexx

Flexx has a modular design, consisting of a few subpackages, which can
also be used by themselves. See the table of contents below. For building
apps these three modules are the most relevant:

* :doc:`flexx.ui <ui/index>` - the widgets
  (see :doc:`intro <ui/intro>`, :doc:`api <ui/api>`, :doc:`examples <ui/examples>`)
* :doc:`flexx.app <app/index>` - the event loop and server
  (see :doc:`intro <app/intro>`, :doc:`api <app/api>`, :doc:`examples <app/examples>`)
* :doc:`flexx.event <event/index>` - properties and events
  (see :doc:`intro <event/intro>`, :doc:`api <event/api>`, :doc:`examples <event/examples>`)
